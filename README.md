# Automated PupillometryR Preprocess Script for .csv
 This script is to automate the preproccessing in the package pupillometryR for .csv files
 It includes 2 scripts, one is for each file separately and the other one is looping each file in the specified folder.
 If you have the required data type for the package PupillometryR, you can adjust this script to your data. There is also added baseline function:
 I have added this because not all my trials had the same duration of baseline and I needed to adjust, but you can just ignore the use of this function and adjust the code to your needs.
